# Steps for Deploying the Entire Flow
I started off by creating a directory for the two files for the static website. The files created were index.html and style.css. I went to ChatGPT and asked it to give me HTML and CSS code for a static website for a company that provides a weather application. I also asked it to give me a company name, include an About Us section, and talk about some of the features of the weather application. I copied the code provided by ChatGPT and added it to the relevant files. 

I then staged the project directory to the Git repository and set the Git global configuration to my GitHub username and email and committed the initial code. I then had to create a repository on GitHub with the name "src" and link my local repository from the environment with my GitHub and push the commit from the local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.
