The static landing page runs on a kubernetes local environment which is set up in a docker container using Kind. Dockerfile was created with nginx as the base image, set the nginx working directory, and copied the 'src' folder into the working directory so the web server could access the relevant files and opened it to port 80. I then built the image using the command "docker build -t dockerfile ." and ran the image using the command "docker run -p 8080 80 dockerfile" and opened it to port 8080 and accessed it on localhost to check if everything worked and looks proper and if any changes needed to happen. 

After confirming the website and the dockerfile are configured properly, it's time to push the dockerfile to the docker hub. I used the command 'docker tag webapp jagdip0/webapplication:1.0' to tag the image with a name, docker username, repository name, and version. Then I used the command "docker login -u jagdip0" to log into the docker hub and it asked for my password and logged me in. I used the command "docker push jagdip0/webapplication:1.0" to push the image to the docker hub and went to the docker hub on my browser to confirm the image was successfully pushed to the docker hub.

Then I had to install the Kind tool that runs kubernetes clusters using docker on the local environment. As the Kind tool got installed it confirmed if Docker was installed on the local environment, as it were, it linked the kind tool with the docker environment. I then created a cluster using "kind create cluster", which created a control plane inside the docker container. I then started creating kuberneted Deployment YAML file which specified the image, which was the one I pushed to the docker hub, I also specified the number of replicas for the deployment. Then I used the command "kubectl apply -f app-deployment.yaml" to apply the deployment to the cluster, which creates the specified number of pods, names them, uses the specified image, and opens the pod to port 80. I also created another yaml file for 'service' and specified the port configuration to "ClusterIP" and applied it to the cluster using the same command.

For the last step I had to make sure the static website was accessible and working properly. For that, I had to use the command "kubectl port-forward 80" to access the landing page from the localhost. I then opened my browser and accessed localhost and it directed me to the static landing page.
